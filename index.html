	  <h1> Gluss = Slug + Truss + Glass </h1>
	  <h2> Premise </h2>
	  The Gluss Project seeks to build Gluss, a robotic material that moves like a slug but is strong like a truss. We are exploring using networks of linear acutators connected in triangular shapes to build strong spaceframes that can ooze into position.
	  The Gluss Project is a part of <a href="https://github.com/PubInv/PIFAH">Public Invention</a>, which seeks to invent things directly beneficial to all humanity without seeking profit or patents. The project was started in August, 2015.
	  <h2> Status </h2>
	  Currently the Gluss Project is mostly Robert L. Read, although we welcome your assistance. We have acheived a crawling robot made of three tetrahedra. Technically, this a "3TetGlussbot", but we are seeking a more personal name.
	  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1T8XSMhwKUE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
	  <p>
	  You may wish to subscribe to our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T8XSMhwKUE">YouTube Channel</a>, since because motion is so intrinsic to the Gluss Project, videos are good way to show what we are doing.
	  The 3TetGlussbot uses commercial linear acuators and the "Turret Joint", an invention of Kwon, Song and Kim, implemented by Rob using a 3D printer. It is controlled by two Arduino Mega with an open-source shield we designed ourselves to allow up to 6 motors to be controlled with a single Mega. An Emacs lisp program communicates via bluetooth with the two controller, giving us a command line interface to control the robot.
	  </p>
	  <h2> Motivation </h2>
	  <p>
	    Imagine a strong, light, metamorphic robotic substance. The uses of such a substance are limited only by our ability to imagine them.
	    Imagine a bridge that crawls into place in a matter of hours. Imagine constructing a temporary highway overpass in 24 hours, or a pedestrian bridge for a festival in the morning that comes down in the evening.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Imagine a snake-like robot that can crawl into a collapsed building and hold the roof up while survivors are extracted. Imagine material that combines the functionality of forklift, a crane, a bulldozer and a backhoe, all in one machine. Imagine a very small gluss that crawl into and holds shut a wound, temporarily taking the place of missing tissue.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    It is hard to imagine humanity exploring the stars in peace without gluss at its side.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    We've made a couple of videos showing physcial models and discussing our motivation:

	  <h2>How You Can Get Involved</h2>
	  <p>
	   We want to help the world by harnessing the creativity of amateur and professional makers.
	    </p>
	  <p>
	    We need competent and energetic artists, writers, video editors, designers, and thinkers. Those functions are just as important as the skills more obviously particular to this project. Perhaps it goes without saying that we also need programmers, Arduino programmers, 3D Printers, mechanical engineers, and electrical engineers. Depending on what you want to research, we also need mathematicians, structural engineers, mechanical engineers,  and roboticists.
	    </p>
	  <h3>Contact</h3>
	  <p>
	    Because this is a genuine research project and everyone has different talents and interests, the best way to get involved is to email <a href="mailto: read.robert@gmail.com">Rob &lt;read.robert@gmail.com&gt;</a> directly to discuss what you are most interested in.
	  </p>
	  <h3>Support us on Social Media</h3>
	  <p>
	    If you aren't ready to contact us directly, you can support us via social media by:
	    <ul>
	      <li> Subscribing to and liking videos on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T8XSMhwKUE">YouTube Channel</a>.
	      </li>
	      <li> Sharing this website and mentioning the Gluss concept to your friends.
		</li>
	      </ul>
	    <h3>Build Your Own Glussbot</h3>
	  <p> You may want to build your own Glussbot for a playful or serious purpose. All of files needed to do this are published in our various GitHub Repos. The total process is not yet well-documented. It would be a great service to the project if someone
	    would make or assist us in making an Instructable about any phase of the project. The Bill of Materials is about $1300 for the 3-TetGlussbot. We will happily assist you in this to improve our documentation.
	    </p>
	  <h3>Use our Open-Source 6-controller Arduino Mega Shield</h3>
	  <p> As part of this work, we need a Bluetooth-enabled microcontroller that could control up to six 0.6-amp motors. Our approach was to design an <a href="https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/fijpozoB">open-source shield</a> for the Arduino Mega. Any one can freely reuse this design or can order the board from OshPark and then solder it together themselves. We are unaware of any similar 6-channel controller. Promoting our controller helps promote the Gluss Project.
	  </p>

	  <h3> Some specific things we need...</h3>
	  Thes are <a href="https://github.com/PubInv/gluss/issues">issues</a> in GitHub. This allows you to comment on them, ask questions, and even assign them to yourself.
	    <ul>
	      <li> We need someone to sketch drawings of the "moving bridge" concept and other uses of Gluss to fire the imagine of would-be participants.
	      </li>
	      <li> We need someone familiar with the robotics community to tell us where to publish an academic paper explaining the gluss concept.
	      </li>
	      <li> We need several instructables produced, about the Turret Joint, the Glussbot, and the Mega shield.
	      </li>
	      </ul>
	  <h2>Subprojects Spawned from The Gluss Project</h2>
	  <p>
	    The project has done a number of things so far that might be useful to others in some way. Everything we do is freely resuable under various licenses.
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      The <a href="https://github.com/PubInv/S-Expr">Arduino S-Expr</a> project and its <a href="https://github.com/PubInv/Arduino-S-Expr-Test">test project</a> may be useful to anyone who wants to control an Arduino from Lisp or prefer S-Expressions to the closely related JSON format.
	      </li>
	    <li>
	      The <a href="https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/fijpozoB">3x2 Motor Controller MegaShield, v0.2</a> may be useful to anyone who wants to control up to six DC motors (up to 1 amp each) at the same time.<br>
	      	  <img width="30%" src="./images/NakedBoard.png"/>	  
	      </li>
	    <li>
	      The <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1043716">Turret Joint</a> Open-SCAD files are completely parametrizable and would allow anyone to make their own Turret Joints. This includes for static applications. For example, the Turret Joint can be thought of as a static construction system that allows somewhat more angular freedom than existing static construction systems.<br>
	      	      	  <img width="30%" src="./images/OpenSCADScreen.png"/>	  
	      </li>
	    <li>
	      The <a href="http://pubinv.github.io/CoilChoice/">CoilChoice</a> project may be valuable to anyone desiging coils for the purpose of producing Magnetomotive Force (such as solenoids.) The CoilChoice project was created when we were still attempting to build our own actuator (the GlussPusher project.)<br>
	      <img width="30%" src="./images/CoilChoiceScreen.png"/>	  
	      </li>
	  </ul>

	  <h2>The Intellectual Underpinnings of The Gluss Project</h2>
	  Like most ideas, the idea of gluss is a melding of several pre-existing ideas:
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller">Buckminster Fuller</a> advocated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergetics_(Fuller)">thinking</a> about structures as fully triangulated rigid structures.
	      <img width="30%" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Synergetics_abmod.gif"/>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      We seek to dissolve the distinction between a machine and structure. Every machine is a structure, and every structure moves, if only while being assembled.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      The Song, Kwon, Kim <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20010002964A1/en">spherical joint</a> allows angular displacement for many members coming into a point.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      Three-D printing lets us construct this "<a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1043716">turret joint</a>" inexpensively.<br/>
	      <img width="30%" src="./images/TurretJointPieces.png"/>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      Biomimetics argues for mimicing animals, but we believe it is best to mimic the lower animals, such as single-celled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoeba">amoebae</a> or molluscs which move by the production of pseudopods:  <img width="30%" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Amebas.jpg/484px-Amebas.jpg"/>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      No discussion of pseudopods is complete without a mention of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoggoth">shoggoths</a>:<br/> <img width="30%" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Shoggoth_by_pahko.jpg"/>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      ...although many readers may be more comfortable with the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flubber_(film)">Flubber</a>!
	      </li>
	  </ul>

	  <h2>Next Steps and Research Directions </h2>
	  <p>The Gluss Projects engenders many research opportunities.</p>
	  <h3>Build a Simulator</h3>
	  We need a software-only simulator so that gaits and other forms of motion can be investigated and developed without having to actually have Glussbot. Ideally this would have a 3D rendering display and allow both programatic and interactive design of motion.
	  <h3>Build a physical model with sensors</h3>
	  It would be magical to control a Glussbot by holding in your hands a small model of the robot that you can move and reshape. Such a model would not need acutators, but each member would need to sense and report its length. Then a change with your hands would immediately create a change in the Glussbot, allowing you to control it elegantly.
	  <h3>Develop 3D Printable Magnetic Joints Similar to the GeoMag System</h3>
	  Although the turret joint is a valuale embodiment, it may be possible to build a larger version of the magnet-and-ball-bearing system known as "Geo Mag". Nothing is stopping us from testing this but the time it takes to develop mounts that holds magnets and mount to the Firgelli actuators.
	  <h3>Explore more numerous tetrahedral Gluss systems</h3>
	  Our immediate plans are to build a 5-tetrahedron Glussbot and explore if it can crawl faster than the 3-Tet system. However, we could build and control significantly larger systems.
	  <h3>Build a very small Glussbot</h3>
	  It is interesting to investigate what is the smallest Glussbot system we can construct.
	  <h3>Build a Glussbot out of Hydraulic Actuators</h3>
	  Some gluss constructed out of the enormously powerful hydraulic actauators used on backhoes and bulldozers would be a fascinating machine, if only as an art project. Possibly the simple attachmend of a bulldozer blade would create an interesting machine that would actually be useful.
	  <h3>Research Mathematics of Gluss Dancing</h3>
	  The current control system is very primitive, although it is able to accomplish crawling. It is now clear that we need a way to express and think about more complex and smooth motion over time---the choreography of a gluss dance. This math would be applicable to other sorts of robots as well.
