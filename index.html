	  <h1> Gluss = Slug + Truss + Glass </h1>
	  <h2> Premise </h2>
	  The Gluss Project seeks to build Gluss, a robotic material that moves like a slug but is strong like a truss. We are exploring using networks of linear acutators connected in triangular shapes to building strong spaceframes that can ooze into position.
	  The Gluss Project is a part of Public Invention, which seeks to invent things directly beneficial to all humanity without seeking profit or patents. The project was started in August, 2015.
	  <h2> Status </h2>
	  Currently the Gluss Project is mostly Robert L. Read, although we welcome your assistance. We have acheived a crawling robot made of three tetrahedra. Technically, this a "3TetGlussBot", but we are seeking a more personal name.

	  <p>
	  You may wish to subscribe to our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T8XSMhwKUE">YouTube Channel</a>, since because motion is so intrinsic to the Gluss Project, videos are good way to show what we are doing.
	  The 3TetGlussBot uses commercial linear acuators and the "Turret Joint", an invention of Kwon, Song and Kim, implemented by Rob using a 3D printer. It is controlled by two Arduion Mega with an open-source shield we designed ourselves to allow up to 6 motors to be controlled with a single Mega. An Emacs lisp program communicates via bluetooth with the two controller, giving us a command line interface to control the robot.
	  </p>
	  <h2> Motivation </h2>
	  <p>
	    The uses of a strong, light, metamorphic robotic spaceframe are limited only by our imagination. Imagine a bridge that crawls into place in a matter of hours. Imagine constructing a temporary highway overpass in 24 hours, or a pedestrian bridge for a festival in the morning that comes down in the evening.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Imagine a snake-like robot that can crawl into a collapsed building and hold the roof up while survivors are extracted. Imagine material that combines the functionality of forklift, a crane, a bulldozer and a backhoe, all in one machine. Imagine a very small gluss that crawl into and hold shut a wound, temporarily taking the place of missing tissue.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    It is hard to imagine humanity exploring the stars in peace without gluss at its side.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    We've made a couple of videos showing physcial models and discussing our motivation:

	  <h2>How You Can Get Involved</h2>
	  <p>
	    Open source hardware is more difficult than opens source hardware development, because the number of people with the skills and inclination to do it are fewer, and the expense is higher. Nonetheless Public Invention seeks to be a third pole, forming an alternative to academic research and commercial development. We want to help the world by harnessing the creativity of amateur makers.
	    </p>
	  <p>
	    We need competent and energetic artists, writers, video editors, designers, and thinkers. Those functions are just as important as the more skills more obviously particular to this project. Perhaps it goes without saying that we also need programmers, Arduino programmers, 3D Printers, mechanical engineers, electrical engineers. Depending on what you want to research, we also need mathematicians, structural engineers, mechanical engineers, electrical engineers, and roboticists.

	  <h3>Contact</h3>
	  <p>
	    Because this is a genunine research project and everyone has different talents and interests, the best way to get involved is to email <a href="mailto: read.robert@gmail.com">Rob</a> directly to discuss what you are most interested in.
	  </p>
	  <h3>Support us on Social Media</h3>
	  <p>
	    If you aren't ready to contact us directly, you can support us via social media by:
	    <ul>
	      <li> Subscribing to and liking videos on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T8XSMhwKUE">YouTube Channel</a>.
	      </li>
	      <li> Sharing this website and mentioning the Gluss concept to your friends.
		</li>
	      </ul>
	    <h3>Build Your Own GlussBot</h3>
	  <p> You may want to build your own GlussBot as a toy or for a serious purpose. All of files needed to do this are published in our various GitHub Repos. The total process is not well-documented. It would be a great service to the project if someone
	    would make or assist us in making an Instructable about any phase of the project.
	    </p>
	  <h3>Use our Open-Source 6-controller Arduino Mega Shield</h3>
	  <p> As part of this work, we need a Bluetooth-enabled microcontroller that could control up to six 0.6-amp motors. Our approach was to design an open-source shield for the Arduino Mega. Any one can freely reuse this design or can order the board from OshPark and then solder it together themselves. We are unaware of any similar 6-channel controller. Promoting our controller helps promote the Gluss Project.
	  </p>

	  <h2>Some Achievements So Far...</h2>
	  <p>
	    The project has done a number of things so far that might be useful to others in some way. Everything we do is freely resuable under various licenses.
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      The Arduino S-Expr project may be useful to anyone who wants to control an Arduino from Lisp or prefer S-Expres to the closely related JSON format.
	      </li>
	    <li>
	      The MegaShield may be useful to anyone who wants to control 6 DC motors at the same time.
	      </li>
	    <li>
	      The Turret Joint Open-SCAD files are completely parametrizable and would allow anyone to make their own Turret Joints. This includes for static applications. For example, the Turret Joint can be thougth of as an improvement on Tinker Toys and other systems in allow somewhat more angular freedom.
	      </li>
	    <li>
The CoilChoice project may be valuabe to anyone desiging coils for the purpose of producing Magnetomotive Force (such as solenoids.)
	      </li>
	    </ul>
