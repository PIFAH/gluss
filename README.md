# gluss

Nascent repo to hold information about Gluss robots in general (as opposed to GlussPusher, my attempt to make cheap linea
actuators.)

TODO:
* Develop the dual-tetrahedra based robot and make it walk.
* Complete the tetrahelix joint 3D printable design and create enough for us to build the Dual-Tet robot.
* Create a rolling octahedron just to prove that we can do it.
* Create a joint with larger extent to act as "Feet" for the Dual-Tet, which is barely flat enough. Use existing rotor
structure to do this.
* Purchase some large ball bearings in order to test possibility of magnetic joints
* Design Firgelli mounts to hold magnets and print enough to try it.
* order Arduino Mega and sufficient h-drivers to control the Dual-tet
* Get BlueTooth control working.
* Design "folding joint" to make an edge based on servos -- low priority.
